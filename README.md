============

This project has been created to help a bunch of students (including myself) to generate reports about Testing Plans  for the subject "Proyecto Final (Final Project)" at Universidad Tecnologica Nacional, Facultad Regional Mendoza.

In a very short amount of time this small objective was fulfilled. Since then, I'm trying to add more funcionalities to the project. Next milestone is to create an app to register Requirements for a Software Project, using Use Case Descriptions, this includes a Basic Path and all the Alternatives Path, mainly.

The final objective is to achieve more functionalities that could be use by students at this University, in order to reduce their spent time in this kind of tasks, since they are very repetitive and are included in a lot of subjects through the five years of Engineering of Information Systems.
